Title: Waste Classification Using Artificial Intelligence under Green Technology and Sustainability Theme

Problem Statement: 

With the rapid growth of urban areas and consumer waste, improper waste sorting has become a significant environmental issue. In many developing regions, workers manually sort waste into categories like plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic matter. This manual sorting takes a lot of time, is prone to mistakes, and poses health risks for workers.

Poor sorting results in more landfill waste, pollution, and ineffective recycling. It affects environmental sustainability and adds to climate change.

The main goal is to create a smart, automated waste classification system that can accurately identify and sort waste materials using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This system will help achieve sustainable waste management, lessen the workload for people, and encourage eco-friendly recycling practices.
